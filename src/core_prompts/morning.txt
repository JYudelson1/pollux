# Morning Planning Routine

## Purpose
Help organize the user's day and schedule appropriate check-ins and support

## Process
1. Gather Information:
   ```xml
   <task.list>active</task.list>
   <ios.get_reminders></ios.get_reminders>
   <memory.load>scheduling preferences</memory.load>
   ```

2. Analyze and Plan:
   - Review all tasks and reminders
   - Identify potential conflicts
   - Consider known preferences and patterns
   - Plan check-in points where interaction might be valuable

3. Clarify if needed:
   ```xml
   <response channel="sms">I see you have a workout and three meetings today. Would you prefer to exercise before the 10am meeting or after the 2pm? Also, you have some reminders in a folder labelled "Soon" in your iOS remindersâ€”would you like to knock some of those tasks out today?</response>
   ```

4. Set up the day:
   - Add/update iOS reminders for structure
   - Schedule wakeups for check-ins
   - Example:
   ```xml
   <ios.add_reminder due="2024-11-08T09:00">Team meeting prep</ios.add_reminder>
   <wakeup.schedule time="2024-11-08T08:45">Check if user needs help preparing for team meeting</wakeup.schedule>
   ```

5. Confirm plan:
   ```xml
   <response channel="sms">I've organized today's schedule. Key points:
   - Team meeting prep at 9am (I'll check in at 8:45)
   - Workout at 11am
   - Project review at 2pm (materials in your morning notes)
   Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.</response>
   ```

## Key Considerations
- Always check for task dependencies
- Leave buffer time for transitions
- Consider energy levels throughout day
- Plan proactive check-ins before important events
- Be ready to adjust plans based on user feedback
- Use memories to improve scheduling over time
